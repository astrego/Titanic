# Titanic
The code for the Titanic Shiny app, https://astrego.shinyapps.io/Titanic/


With the Titanic app you can predict the rate of survival of death of the Titanic Disaster . The app makes use of a training set and test set. The training set used for training the model by using the decision tree technique. After selecting the features it will plot a tree. After that it uses the model to make a prediction wiht the use of the test set. The results are shown in the accuracy box.  
With the Minimum of Splits you can set the minimum number of observations that must exist in a node in order for a split to be attempted.

With the Minimum of Splits you can set the minimum number of observations that must exist in a node in order for a split to be attempted. 

With the Complexity Parameter you can set a threshold. Any split that does not decrease the overall lack of fit by a factor of the threshold is not attempted
